  <h1>Yellow Patch</h1>
  <h2>Old Lady Anita, living alone in her home, takes great pride in having 
      nice things. From her antiques her Gro√ümutter gave her that bring an 
      overarching Schwarzerwald (Black Forest) feel. And as she was raised to 
      believe, no one can do the work as well as you. Well, that is something 
      Old Lady Anita believes wholeheartedly.<br><br>
      Help Old Lady Anita keep her lawn free of a marauding pack of the little 
      orange puff dogs. Use the arrow keys to help Anita navigate her yard. And 
      should yuou find yourself upon one of the pomeranians, press the spacebar 
      to help Anita shoo away that dog before they releives itself and  
      on Anita's lawn.<br><br>
      Shoo ten dogs out of her yard to successfully defend against the invasion
      but you must do so before three such dogs have a chance to urinate on the lawn.</h2>
