# Yellow Patch - The Battle of Our Lawns

## Premise:

name of the game, why you're building, link to the live version

## Prep Materials
user stories, wireframes

## Approach
a bit about your development process and planning strategies


## Outstanding Bugs that need to be fixed
Currently there is a lag in the code between when the winning number is acheived and when the win function is implemented. That is something that I want to work on but, at current, I am unable to figure out on my own.

## Stretch Goals
My stretch goals are as follows:
1. Establish multiple kinds of dogs that produce different sizes/quantities of yellow spots at different time intervals.
2. Add images for Anita and the various dogs that appear in her yard.
3. Add a level option so that as you advance through the levels, the rate at which dogs show up lessens.
4. Add the ability to save your initials and for the ten highest scores to display on the Win page under the greeting.


## Credits
Thank you, Google, for without your lovely image search option I would have no images of grass.
