# Yellow Patch - The Battle of Our Lawns

## Premise:

name of the game, why you're building, link to the live version

## Prep Materials
user stories, wireframes

## Approach
a bit about your development process and planning strategies


## Outstanding Bugs that need to be fixed
Currently there is a lag in the code between when the winning number is acheived and when the win function is implemented. That is something that I want to work on but, at current, I am unable to figure out on my own.

## Stretch Goals
My stretch goals are as follows:
- establish multiple kinds of dogs that produce different sizes/quantities of yellow spots at different time intervals.
-Add images for Anita and the various dogs that appear in her yard.
-Add a level option so that as you advance through the levels, the rate at which dogs show up lessens.
-Add the ability to save your initials and for the ten highest scores to display on the Win page under the greeting.


## Credits
Thank you, Google, for without your lovely image search option I would have no images of grass.
