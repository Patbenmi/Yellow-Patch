# Yellow Patch - The Battle of Our Lawns

## Premise:
The name of this application is Yellow Patch. I decided to create this after being presenting with perameters of a project that required a fully-operational interactive game. This project, the first major assignment in my course, was issued in order to display successful attainment of the necessary skills covered in Unit 1 - HTML, CSS & JavaScript.

Here is a link to the live version of this project -  -----------

## Prep Materials
So, when originally presented with the project outline, I was amiss. I could not figure out what kind of game I would create and I didn't know what subject to have it cover. One of the last things that my cohort covered in class before break was Canvas, which I immediately felt would be the medium for me to utilize. At the time I was fairly comfortable with both flex and grid but I decided that grid should be used.

But what subject should I cover? What skin to put my game in. Then I thought about my lovely former neighbor and current grandmother, Anita Pettigrew. Anita is always in her lawn, weather-permitting, and had the most manicured lawn in the neighborhood. Her lawn is sodded with a regionally-appropriate native grass, unlike others who had their lawns resodded with types of grass native to the eastern, wetter regions of the United States. 

That's when it hit me: *whenever I walk my dog, I purposefully avoided her lawn. Why not create a game that documented her struggles with the neighborhood dogs?* Most of the dogs in the neighborhood small toy-sized dogs, with a significant portion of them being Pomeranians. The game simply came together.

## Approach
In the beginning, I wanted everything to generate in one page. I quickly found that abhorrent. so I decided to create several pages - an introduction page, a game page, and a win & lose page. To be honest, my project is a bunch of DOM manipulator functions and conditional statements. Embedded functions are something that I feel that I've become better at understanding and utilizing. 

## Outstanding Bugs that need to be fixed
Currently there is a lag in the code between when the winning number is acheived and when the win function is implemented. That is something that I want to work on but, at current, I am unable to figure out on my own.

## Stretch Goals
My stretch goals are as follows:
1. Establish multiple kinds of dogs that produce different sizes/quantities of yellow spots at different time intervals.
2. Add images for Anita and the various dogs that appear in her yard.
3. Add a level option so that as you advance through the levels, the rate at which dogs show up lessens.
4. Add the ability to save your initials and for the ten highest scores to display on the Win page under the greeting.


## Credits
Thank you, Google, for without your lovely image search option I would have no images of grass. Also, shoutouts to W3schools and MDN because, having created this application over a holiday break, my instructors were not readily available. Those resources worked wonders concerning functions embedded in JavaScript.
